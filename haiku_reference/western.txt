Snow in my shoe Abandoned Sparrowâ€™s nest.
Whitecaps on the bay: A broken signboard banging In the April wind.
Lily: out of the water out of itself.
Bass picking bugs off the moon.
quail excited in dirt turned up by a gopher.
ground squirrel balancing its tomato on the garden fence.
Just friends: he watches my gauze dress blowing on the line.
A little boy sings on a terrace, eyes aglow.
Western meteor shower a gentle wave wets our sandals.
