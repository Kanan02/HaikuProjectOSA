Autumn moonlight – a worm digs silently into the chestnut.
Old pond a frog jumps the sound of water.
Autumn wind – mountain’s shadow wavers.
Don’t weep, insects – Lovers, stars themselves, Must part.
In the coolness of the empty sixth-month sky... the cuckoo’s cry.
the tree cut, dawn breaks early at my little window.
the first cold shower even the monkey seems to want a little coat of straw.
